# Project-2.5.11
This is our project 2.5.11
It is the game of Nim, a two player game in which each player takes a tile until they are all gone
The player has to take at least one tile and not more than half, and whoever takes the last one loses.
Our take on this game includes a high score counter, an option to replace the loser, and a win counter.
